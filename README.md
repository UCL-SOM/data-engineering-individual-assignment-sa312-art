The project includes:
1- Scraping a sample of tweets related to vaccines/vaccination (Scraping.py),

2- Creating labeling functions to label these tweets and differentiate it as an official or non-official one using Snorkel (Snorkel.py)

3- Developing NLP sentiment analysis to predict the label (NLP Sentiment Analysis Model.ipynb)

4- Deploying the ML model using Flask (Flask - ML deployment), Docker (Dokcer - ML deployment), and Google Cloud Platform (GCP - ML deployment)

5- Employing Spark Streaming to extract tweets on real time and conducting an analysis about the vaccines' hashtags (Spark Streaming Tweets Analysis.ipynb)

6- Storing and processing the scrapped data in Mongo-DB and AWS Dynamo-DB (Lambda code.py)
